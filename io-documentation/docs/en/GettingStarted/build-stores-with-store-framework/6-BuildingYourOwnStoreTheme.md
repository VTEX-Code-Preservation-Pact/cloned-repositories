# 6. Building your own store theme

Throughout this track, you understood what *workspace*, *VTEX IO CLI*, *Store Theme* and *blocks* are, in addition to learning how to customize your store’s pages by configuring *templates* and defining *styles*. 

It's time to put your knowledge to the task and to practice by creating a store theme to call your own from scratch - block by block, style by style. Are you ready?
