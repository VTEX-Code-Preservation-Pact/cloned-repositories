# 6. Structuring the documentation

Now that your Pixel app is defined, it is time to create its **documentation**! 

Creating a documentation for your app is one of the most essential parts of your development journey, since the documentation will be the one responsible for presenting your app functionality to its future users.

Knowing this, the VTEX IO team provides a documentation **template** to help you in this process:

1. Access your app's `docs` folder.
2. Access the `README.md` file.

In the `README.md` file, you will find several recommendations to your documentation. Read them carefully and make the updates according to your scenario.  

>ℹ️ Keep in mind that documentation is a ongoing process: update your app's `README.md` file whenever a new release impacts the user experience.
