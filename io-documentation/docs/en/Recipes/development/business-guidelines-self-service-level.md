# Self-service level

VTEX App Store's mission is to provide scalable, reliable and high-level self-service solutions to our retailers anywhere in the world.
For your app to be approved in our homologation process, it must:
- Be plug and play.
- Offer a direct support channel.
- Have technical documentation.

## Plug&Play
Those interested in your application should be able to install and configure it on their own, using only the VTEX admin panel to enable its features.

External assistance to support the app implementation process should not be considered an option. For homologation approval, it is required that your application is plug and play. 

## Support channel
Every application in the VTEX App Store must provide a direct support channel for retailers who install it, such as email, phone, ticketing tool, or a combination of these options. 

In addition, the first response time must be a maximum of eight business hours in the developer's time zone. This requirement aims to ensure that store operations will not be affected by errors in third-party applications.

## Technical documentation 
Provide official documentation to support future users in implementing and understanding the application. 

This documentation should include all the technical and commercial requirements for the application's operation, installation and configuration, the frequently asked questions (FAQ) among users who have installed it, etc.
