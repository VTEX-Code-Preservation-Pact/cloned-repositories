# Site Editor
Site Editor works as a [CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-cms) specially designed for [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-store-framework) users.

The Site Editor reflects the VTEX account's Store Theme. According to what was defined in the source code, the admin section displays the website storefront, enabling non-technical users to manage as desired the content, including components and their behavior, through a friendly interface.
