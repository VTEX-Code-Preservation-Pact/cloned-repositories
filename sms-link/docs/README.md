# VTEX SMSLink

Allows the sending of transactional SMS messages to customers using SMSLink SMS Gateway. This application uses [Feed v3 Hook](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/feed-v3) for receiving status updates from OMS.

# How it works?

1. For [Feed V3 Hooks](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/feed-v3)

When one of the `order-created`, `cancel`, `payment-approved` or `payment-denied` events is received, the app will check if the corresponding option fields are checked (if it is allowed to send the transactional message or not). If the app is allowed to send the transactional message then it will retrieve the order data and send the message to the customer phone number through the SMSLink SMS Gateway.

2. For `vtex.return-app`[^1]

When the return request state changes to one of the following states: `New`, `Picked up from client`, `Approved` or `Denied` the `vtex.return-app` will send a request to the SMSLink app through `https://{accountName}.myvtex.com/sms-link-app/send-sms` route. The SMSLink app will then check if it is allowed to send the transactional message according to the specified event and send the message to the custumer phone number through the SMSLink SMS Gateway.
