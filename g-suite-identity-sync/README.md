G Suite Identity Sychronizer synchronize accounts and groups managed by G Suite to LDAP. It can be used as authentication and authorization provider to any service that supports LDAP (e.g. [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Sonatype Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/), [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Freeradius](https://freeradius.org/), etc.) while user & group management is still managed by G Suite.

Read [Wiki](https://github.com/hlavki/g-suite-identity-sync/wiki) to [install](https://github.com/hlavki/g-suite-identity-sync/wiki/Install) application.

## Features

* Synchronize G Suite accounts or regular gmail accounts to LDAP
* Synchronize G Suite groups to LDAP groups
* Support for external users (gmail only)
* Synchronize LDAP password to G Suite (One password for everything)
* Synchronize name changes to LDAP
* Support to choose username from G Suite aliases
* Scheduled synchronizers (TODO)

## What is this good for

This software is good for all G Suite customers who need to use services that support only LDAP authentication or authorization, especially for software startup companies.

## How it works

Account synchronization is driven by users. It means that account is synchronized when user uses account manager web to create account.
Every account must be G Suite account or regular gmail account with specific G Suite group membership.
There is no possibility to use G Suite password but you can synchronize LDAP password to G Suite.
Groups are synchronized on user creation, scheduler on manually.
