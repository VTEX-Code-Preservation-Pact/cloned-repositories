#### Components still under development, whose support may cease without further notice. Avoid using them in Production.

Experimental components may undergo breaking changes despite major, minor or patch versions of Styleguide. They might be lacking proper documentation or have their APIs completely rewritten. They are however in a functional state where multiple teams may start sharing their code to work together.

Feel free to use them and contribute providing feedback on GitHub or Slack.
