name: Request for new component
about: A guide for requesting and documenting new components for our Styleguide.

---

<!-- This is a guide to help get your mental juices flowing, and NOT a rigid and bureaucratic form to be filled out. Scrape everything and start from scratch if it doesn't work for you ;)

<!-- Let's try to capture the best possible your context and needs so we can design a great component together! -->

## Overview

<!-- Explain objectively in a few sentences what this component is about. This is like the component's greeting card. -->

## Purpose

<!-- 
- Which problems were you trying to solve when you came up with this?
- What use cases would it cover that other components don't?
- Are there existing Styleguide components that might be similar but that don't work for you? Why?
-->

## Context

<!--
It's screenshot time! Don't worry about cropping it, it's good if you capture the full context of your application.
-->

## Examples

<!--
Can you point out to existing solutions in other products that you think would work for you?
