# Native A/B testing

Run clear and effective A/B tests natively while minimizing store losses from potential drops in conversion. 

:information_source: A/B testing is a scientific marketing tool that compares two possible variations of the same page, ensuring that you don't waste time on guessing which of the two would best fit your business and allowing you to make decisions based on real conversion rates. 

## What has changed

It was previously not possible to perform an A/B testing natively using VTEX IO platform. Clients interested in the improving their business performance through A/B testing would have needed to run such tests separately from the IO solution. 

At present, VTEX IO A/B testing is available to everyone looking to use the tool, allowing your store to balance traffic between workspaces and their respective conversion rates.

## Main advantages

Our native A/B testing solution were designed for e-commerce solutions and allow VTEX IO clients to expand the potential of the results and minimize their losses on possible drops of conversion rates. 

## What you need to do 

To begin implementing A/B testing in your stores, you need to first install the `vtex.ab-tester` app in an account's master workspace, using the following command:

```
vtex install vtex.ab-tester

```

:warning: Before initializing your tests, do not forget to access the VTEX IO Master documentation on [how to properly perform a A/B testing on your store](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZM0sF22yPxaKZ9jvKWR-h8Ba00shHZS5uWgQmA8Tg7U/edit#heading=h.7nfo9txa2lc8).
