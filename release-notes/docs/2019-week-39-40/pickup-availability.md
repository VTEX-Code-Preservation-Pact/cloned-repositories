# Pickup Availability
 
In the Product Page, the new Pickup Availability component shows the availability of a product in a brick-and-mortar store's inventory selected by the user.

:warning: When selecting a brick-and-mortar store and buying the product afterwards, Pickup Availability does not reserve that product for the user. It only shows the product's availability itself in the chosen store. 

## Main advantages 

The new component is a fundamental tool for strengthening **Omnichannel** experience in your business, allowing users to overcome barriers between brick-and-mortar and online stores. 

## What you need to do

Simply [install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) the `pickup-availability` component in your store.
