description: "The individuality of each block used in a store must be respected, mainly when we talk about customizations. With that in mind, the Product Price can finally showcase the `blockClass` prop! It means that every Product Price block will be able to receive a unique customization each time it appears in your store, no matter how often that happens."

# Product Price

The product Price block just gained a special **new prop**: `blockClass`!

## What has changed

Previously, the Product Price did not accept the `blockClass` prop.  Since blockClass is a prop that functions as a block identifier within your code, all Product Price blocks had to be, before anything else, customized in the same way. 

## Main advantages

With this release, you can **apply specific customizations** for each one of the Product Prices blocks that are part of your theme! 

## What you need to do

It's quick and easy: make sure that the [**Store Components**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.store-components/) app is running version 3.77.0 or higher!
