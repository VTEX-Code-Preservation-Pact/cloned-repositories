> :bell: Keep up with VTEX IO release notes! Just click on **Releases only** in the **Watch** box in the right upper corner of this page.

### New features :rocket:

- [Fold block](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-38/fold-block.md) - Can you decide which store's block will be loaded and rendered after the user scroll down? Yes, you can: simply use the Fold block!
- [GraphQL types import](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-38/graphql-types-import.md) - Save your precious time while developing! From now on, easily import GraphQL types from one app to another.
- [Product Customizer component](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-38/product-customizer-component.md) - ~(finally)~ Display product attachments in your product page using the Product Customizer component.

### Improvements :heavy_plus_sign:

- [Sandbox with OrderForm](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-38/sandbox-with-orderform.md) - The user's cart data can now be used in Sandbox components in a fast and simple way.
- [New Toast CSS handle](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-38/new-toast-css-handle.md) - Customize the Toast component with a different style from the rest of the store thanks to the new CSS handle.
- [Toast component redirect](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-38/toast-component-redirect.md) - Greater control over user browsing is always magical. Use the `BuyButton` and `ProductSummaryBuyButton` new prop and redirect your user to any URL with a simple click on the Toast component.

### Notable bug fixes :bug:

- [Free products on Google Shopping](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store/pull/360) - Products are no longer being displayed as free on Google Shopping since the issue in our structured data that caused this bug was fixed.
- [`i18n` key props](https://github.com/vtex-apps/admin-pages/pull/279) - When editing `i18n` fields, some users were facing an issue with their key props. There were a few scenarios in which the `i18n` key itself was being rendered raw instead of having its value displayed. This PR solves this issue.
- [`__provideRuntime` cache](https://github.com/vtex-apps/admin-pages/pull/280) = The `__provideRuntime` function called the `Messages` service every time changes to a component were performed by the user, such as changing the Shelf title. To improve request responsiveness (previously at ~2s), this PR adds a local cache that returns the messages and avoids making the request whenever possible.
