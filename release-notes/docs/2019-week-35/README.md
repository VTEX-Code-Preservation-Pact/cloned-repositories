# VTEX IO Highlights - Week 35/2019

Welcome to the VTEX IO weekly release notes!

We're extremely happy to have achieved 10 straight weeks of VTEX IO Release Notes ðŸŽ‰ We hope that you're excited as well!

Unfortunately, this week's Release Notes size does not do justice to our impish glee with this achievement. This one comes in a mini format since our team is laser focused on improving the platform's performance.

Check out what were the key changes for the last week:

> :bell: Keep up with VTEX IO release notes! Simply click on **Releases only** in the **Watch** box in the right upper corner of this page.

### New features :rocket:

- [Google Search Box script](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-35/google-search-box-script.md) - Effortlessly display a store's internal search box during Google searches and watch how page access soars.

### Improvements :heavy_plus_sign:

- [Platform performance](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-35/platform-performance.md) - Understand last week's VTEX IO key performance improvement points.

### Notable bug fixes :bug:

- [Shelf `itemsPerPage` limit](https://github.com/vtex-apps/shelf/pull/176) - The Shelf component had a bug that limited the number of items it displayed to 5. Now, whatever number of items the `itemsPerPage` decides is duly displayed.
- [RelatedShelf component](https://github.com/vtex-apps/shelf/pull/179) - The RelatedShelf no longer displays a maximum quantity of products due to not being able to properly identify if it's rendering for mobile or not.
