# Image

Uploading content that is used by the Image component can now be done directly through **Site Editor**, in the admin's CMS.

## What has changed

Prior to this release, this wasn't possible: images that retailers wanted to use in the Image component needed to have been already uploaded somewhere else in order to be referred to in Site Editor.

## Main advantages

Retailers gained **practical ease-of-use** with this release, since there is no longer a need to host the desired images on third party sites and to worry about their management. 

## What you need to do 

Make sure you store tem running version **0.3.0** or higher of the [**Store Image**](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.store-image) app.
