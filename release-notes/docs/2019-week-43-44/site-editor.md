# Site Editor

**GIFs** are now properly accepted for upload in the Site Editor's admin.

## What has changed 

Previously, the Site Editor did not allow the use of GIFs as store media. Even if no error was displayed when trying to upload a GIF, retailers could not properly use it in their store, as the GIF froze in place.

This improvement ensures that **GIFs can not only be uploaded in the Site Editor but can also be properly used** in the store.

## Main advantages

The Site Editor's former behavior was cause for frustration with retailers as it allowed GIFs to be uploaded, but was incapable of effectively supporting them in stores.

This release aims to allow the Site Editor to properly support GIF use, enabling retailers to use **dynamic media** in the store.

## What you need to do 

Absolutely nothing!!! Try out the Site Editor now and use GIFs as media in your store!
