2. Run `vtex install vtexarg.pharma-orders-admin` on the account you're working on.

### Create Entity and Schema

Do a `[PUT]` on `https://:account.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/dataentities/pharmaOrders/schemas/pharma-orders`

`HEADER: VtexIdClientAutCookie`

`BODY:`

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "orderId": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 50,
      "title": "orderId"
    },
    "status": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 50,
      "title": "status"
    },
    "invoiceNumber": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 50,
      "title": "invoiceNumber"
    }
  },
  "required": ["orderId", "status", "invoiceNumber"],
  "v-indexed": ["orderId", "status", "invoiceNumber"],
  "v-security": {
    "publicJsonSchema": true,
    "allowGetAll": false,
    "publicRead": ["orderId", "status", "invoiceNumber"],
    "publicWrite": ["orderId", "status", "invoiceNumber"],
    "publicFilter": ["orderId", "status", "invoiceNumber"]
  }
}
```

### App Setup

1. If you will work in a workspace, you need to redirect the orders flow to the workspace where you are working, you can do it here:
   `https://:account.myvtex.com/admin/apps/vtex.orders-broadcast/setup`

2. You will need to add the `Id` of the `Category Medicamentos`, this is important because the app will only show the orders with products of this category.
